HD Graphics via HDMI.\r\n \r\nHDMI?-The Next Generation Multimedia Interface\r\n&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:130%;color:#FFD400;&quot;&gt;HDMI?-The Next Generation Multimedia Interface&lt;/span&gt;\r\nHDMI? is a High-Definition Multimedia Interface which provides up to 5Gb/s video transmitting bandwidth and 8-channel high quality audio all through a single cable. Able to transmit superior, uncompressed digital video and audio, HDMI? ensures the crispest rendering of digital content up to 1080p without the quality losses associated with analog interfaces and their digital-to-analog conversion. In addition, HDMI? is compatible with HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection), allowing the playback of Blu-ray/HD DVD and other protected media content.\r\n \r\nDVI Support\r\n&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:130%;color:#FFD400;&quot;&gt;DVI Support&lt;/span&gt;\r\nDVI (Digital Visual Interface) is a video interface standard designed for carrying uncompressed digital video data and to maximize the visual quality of digital display devices, such as LCD monitors, digital projectors, and so on. In addition, the DVI interface is compatible with HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection).\r\n \r\n\r\nCPU\r\n\r\nSupport for Intel? Core? i7 processors/Intel? Core? i5 processors/ Intel?

Each LAN and USB port is paired with a dedicated protection filter that can withstand high electrostatic discharges, protecting your system from common electrical surges and even direct lighting strikes.\r\n \r\nPower Failure Protection with Anti-Surge IC\r\nGIGABYTE 9 series Ultra Durable? motherboards also feature special anti-surge ICs that protect your motherboard, and your PC from any surge in power delivery that may occur, helping to ensure that your PC is equipped to deal with any potentially irregular and inconsistent power delivery.\r\n\r\n \r\nHumidity Protection with New Glass Fabric PCB\r\nThere is nothing more harmful to the longevity of your PC than moisture, and most parts of the world experience moisture in the air as humidity at some point during the year. GIGABYTE 9 series motherboards have been designed to make sure that humidity is never an issue, incorporating a new Glass Fabric PCB technology that repels moisture caused by humid and damp conditions.\r\nGlass Fabric PCB technology uses a new PCB material which reduces the amount of space between the fiber weave, making it much more difficult for moisture to penetrate compared to traditional motherboard PCBs. This offers much better protection from short circuit and system malfunction caused by humid and damp conditions.\r\n\r\n \r\n4K Ultra HD Support\r\n&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:130%;color:#FFD400;&quot;&gt;4K Ultra HD Support&lt;/span&gt;\r\n4K resolution is the next technological milestone in high-definition content delivery, utilizing approximately 4,000 pixels on the horizontal axis, more than four times today\'s standard HD pixel density. GIGABYTE motherboards provide native 4K support with integrated Intel? HD Graphics via HDMI.\r\n \r\nHDMI?-The Next Generation Multimedia Interface\r\n&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:130%;color:#FFD400;&quot;&gt;HDMI?-The Next Generation Multimedia Interface&lt;/span&gt;\r\nHDMI? is a High-Definition Multimedia Interface which provides up to 5Gb/s video transmitting bandwidth and 8-channel high quality audio all through a single cable. Able to transmit superior, uncompressed digital video and audio, HDMI? ensures the crispest rendering of digital content up to 1080p without the quality losses associated with analog interfaces and their digital-to-analog conversion. In addition, HDMI? is compatible with HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection), allowing the playback of Blu-ray/HD DVD and other protected media content.\r\nCPU\r\n\r\nSupport for Intel?

(UEFI) Design&lt;/span&gt;\r\nGIGABYTE 9 series Ultra Durable? motherboards feature GIGABYTE DualBIOS?, an exclusive technology from GIGABYTE that protects arguably one of your PC?s most crucial components, the BIOS. GIGABYTE DualBIOS? means that your motherboard has both a ?Main BIOS? and a ?Backup BIOS?, making users protected from BIOS failure due to virus attack, hardware malfunction, improper OC settings or power failure during the update process.\r\n \r\nESD Protection for USB and LAN\r\n&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:130%;color:#FFD400;&quot;&gt;ESD Protection for USB and LAN&lt;/span&gt;\r\nGIGABYTE 9 Series motherboards raise the bar in terms of protecting your system, providing advanced electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection for both your Ethernet LAN and USB ports, both common sources of ESD-related failures. Each LAN and USB port is paired with a dedicated protection filter that can withstand high electrostatic discharges, protecting your system from common electrical surges and even direct lighting strikes.\r\n \r\nPower Failure Protection with Anti-Surge IC\r\nGIGABYTE 9 series Ultra Durable? motherboards also feature special anti-surge ICs that protect your motherboard, and your PC from any surge in power delivery that may occur, helping to ensure that your PC is equipped to deal with any potentially irregular and inconsistent power delivery.\r\n\r\n \r\nHumidity Protection with New Glass Fabric PCB\r\nThere is nothing more harmful to the longevity of your PC than moisture, and most parts of the world experience moisture in the air as humidity at some point during the year. GIGABYTE 9 series motherboards have been designed to make sure that humidity is never an issue, incorporating a new Glass Fabric PCB technology that repels moisture caused by humid and damp conditions.\r\nGlass Fabric PCB technology uses a new PCB material which reduces the amount of space between the fiber weave, making it much more difficult for moisture to penetrate compared to traditional motherboard PCBs. This offers much better protection from short circuit and system malfunction caused by humid and damp conditions.\r\n\r\n \r\n4K Ultra HD Support\r\n&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:130%;color:#FFD400;&quot;&gt;4K Ultra HD Support&lt;/span&gt;\r\n4K resolution is the next technological milestone in high-definition content delivery, utilizing approximately 4,000 pixels on the horizontal axis, more than four times today\'s standard HD pixel density.

In this time, these technologies have altered the ways we communicate, work, learn and play. All these ways have been enhanced and these enhancement have had impacts, so that, now, the method in which affairs are conducted, the means by which organizations evolve and the ways in which relationships are established, have all become optimized. But here in Bangladesh we are far behind from the up to date touch of such technologies.\r\n\r\nWith no defined structure and inadequate support, Bangladeshi companies or organizations are finding it difficult to keep abreast of these new technologies. This situation is further compounded when some private organizations, which provide technological solutions for their clients, do so with out of date and defunct technologies.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this dilemma, SMART Technologies (BD) Ltd was established in 1998 to offer complete technological solutions with the most up to date and recent technologies. STBL?s dedicated staffs are proficient in different aspect of information and communication technologies. From different hardware and operating system platforms, to complex network configuration, SMART?s team will endeavor to provide the best and most recent technological solution that is within the client?s budget.\r\n\r\nSTBL, in its 17 years of business experience has gathered immense reputation in hardware, software, IT enabled services, end to end solutions and networking.
